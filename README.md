## TALKGPT Chatbot
Welcome to the TALKGPT Chatbot project repository! This chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand and respond to user queries and commands. It also integrates voice recognition technology, allowing users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands. The chatbot has text generation capabilities to provide informative and helpful responses to user queries.

### MVP Specification
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the TALKGPT Chatbot project includes the following features:

1. A chatbot that understands and responds to user queries using NLP technology.
2. Integration of voice recognition technology for interacting with the chatbot through voice commands.
3. Text generation capabilities for providing informative and helpful responses.
4. A user-friendly interface with seamless integration of voice activation and speech recognition.
5. Thorough testing to ensure correct functionality and meet user requirements.
6. The programming languages and frameworks used for development are:

- HTML/CSS (React) for the web client
- Node.js (Next.js) for the web server
- The following platforms, tools, and libraries are utilized:

### OpenAI API for NLP capabilities
PyAudio and React SpeechRecognition for voice recognition
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting
Dialogflow for NLP system integration
Firebase (firebaseDB, Auth) for real-time database updates
To mitigate technical risks, the project team employs thorough testing, continuous integration, and backup servers. For non-technical risks, effective marketing, transparent privacy policies, and regular user feedback are incorporated.
